      to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help
      from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and

      description: `Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, 
      a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid.
      The game is played by millions of people worldwide. Chess is believed to have originated in India sometime before the 7th century. 
      The game was derived from the Indian game chaturanga, which is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi, janggi, and shogi. 
      Chess reached Europe by the 9th century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century; the rules were standardized in the 19th century.`,
